<p>This is an ongoing XNA/Monogame project by Tim Stoddard (aka <a href="http://gamepopper.co.uk">Gamepopper</a>) to develop a framework which would be useful for creating 2D games. Feel free to clone this repo or download a ZIP folder of it, play around with it, give comments and suggestions.</p>

<p>The great thing about XNA/Monogame is it's level of complexity; it provides you with enough of a set up that you don't need to right hundreds upon thousands of lines to set up the DirectX features for graphics rendering, sound, input ect, but it also isn't bloated with features, leaving you to set up your structure the way you want it. So while it sounds a bit strange to write a framework for a framework, if you are like me, and have a consistent method of structuring your games, you're much better off writing your own game library with all the classes you need prewritten.</p>

<p>While I'm writing this framework on my own, I've learned a lot about XNA by understanding the methods and techniques of others, mostly in tutorials and publicly released example code. Some specific code snippets will be credited directly in code comments, but here is a basic short list of resources which I have used when learning for this project:</p>

</li>
